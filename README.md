# CMPUT301W21T23-SmartDataBook

This is a mobile application that allows crowd-sourced testing of phenomona. <br/>

There are 4 kinds of crowd-sourced tests for each user: counts (how many did you see), binomial trials (pass fail), non-negative integer counts (each trial has 0 or more), measurement trials (like the temperature). Users in this app are experimenters who create and store such crowd-sourced tests in a Firebase database. <br/>
